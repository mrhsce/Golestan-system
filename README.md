-Project Title   :   Golestan system implementation in client-server structure
-
-Project summary:
-
-In this project we are going to use SQlite for storing data as well as Qt for interface
-
-this program is based on the golestan systems and interface is going to be just like golestan
-
-but in the contrast to the golestan we are going to make this program in client-server structure
-
-server will be installed on the main pc and the cliens on other systems and they will will communicate through network.
-
-another betterment of this application is that great amount of data(student registration data and etc) can be inserted into the program using an xml file.
